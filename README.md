Crafting impactful experiences across design & development.

I'm a passionate designer with 4+ years of experience, currently exploring the intersection of graphic design, UI/UX, and development. I bring a unique blend of creative vision, technical expertise, and a drive to create user-centered solutions.

My Skills:

Graphic Design: Branding, logo design, illustration, typography, layout, and more.
UI/UX Design: User research, information architecture, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing.
Development: Proficient in various front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and familiar with back-end concepts.
Software Expertise: Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects, etc.), Figma, Sketch, and other relevant tools.
Beyond Creative Work:

I'm also an enthusiastic educator, currently sharing my design knowledge as a faculty member. I believe in fostering creativity and empowering others to develop their design skills.
